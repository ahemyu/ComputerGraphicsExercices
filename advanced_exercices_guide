  For every new exercise: 

  1. Copy the exercise folder to the framework:
  cp -r Exercise04/Advanced04 AdvancedFramework/src/
  2. Reconfigure CMake to detect the new exercise:
  cd AdvancedFramework
  cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -Wno-dev -DSDL_PIPEWIRE=OFF
  3. Build:
  cmake --build build --parallel

  When You Modify Code in an Existing Exercise:
  cd AdvancedFramework
  cmake --build build --parallel

and then run with 
cd AdvancedFramework
./src/Advanced03/Advancedn

bc of arch linux setup I have to run it with
env SDL_VIDEODRIVER=x11 ./Advanced03
